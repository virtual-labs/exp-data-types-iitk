 <h3>Data Types</h3>
                     Before starting with arrays you must know the concept of mutability.
An object may be classified into two categories :<br>
i. Mutable<br>
ii. Immutable<br>

Mutable are those objects whose value can be altered after assigning a particular value.
Immutable are those objects whose value can not be altered after assigning of a value.<br>
List And Dictionary are Mutable.<br>
Tuples are Immutable.<br><br>

<h3>Data Type Character</h3>
i.List Mutable<br>
ii.Tuple Immutable<br>
iii.Dictionary Mutable<br>
                    <h4>LIST</h4>It is a collection of data in which date is stored in ordered form.<br>
                    Syntax : object_name = [ elements ]<br>
                    The above mentioned syntax is of list where the elements are mentioned in square brackets.<br><br>
                    Program:<br>
                    <img src="images/img2.PNG"><br>
                    Output<br>
                    ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']<br><br>
                    <h4>Tuple</h4>A tuple is a collection of data which is mostly similar to a list except that it is immutable i.e. the value once stored in a tuple cannot be changed. Though tuple allows concatenation.
                    Syntax : object_name = ( elements ) <br>
                    This is the syntax of a tuple, where elements are placed under parenthesis.<br><br>
                    Program:<br>
                    <img src="images/img3.PNG"><br><br>
                    Output:<br>
                    ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')<br><br>
                    Tuples allow duplicate values:<br>
                    Program:<br>
                    <img src="images/img4.PNG"><br><br>
                    Output:<br>
                    ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry','apple')<br>
 <h4>Dictionary</h4>Dictionary is a collection of data which is not sequential like a list, thus indexing is not possible.
It consists of a key and its value.<br>
Example : dict1 = {1 : "Red", 2 : "Blue", 3 : "Green"}<br>
The above syntax is for a dictionary where the elements are placed under curly brackets.<br>
Program:<br><br>
<img src="images/img5.PNG"><br><br>
Output:<br><br>
{'brand': 'Ford', 'model': 'Mustang', 'year': 1964}
